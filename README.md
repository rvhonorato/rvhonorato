# Hi there, I'm Rodrigo! 👋🏽

I build **distributed systems**, **scientific software**, and **infrastructure tools** with a focus on performance and reliability. With a PhD in Bioinformatics, my work spans from scientific applications to general-purpose backend services and system utilities.

**Engineering & Application Manager** at [Utrecht University / BonvinLab](https://bonvinlab.org) and [EOSC-WeNMR](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl). I oversee the development and maintenance of the [WeNMR Portal](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl) - a production monorepo with Go/Python/Rust microservices - and lead technical development of core components in the [HADDOCK](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3) ecosystem for integrative structural modeling.

**Languages:** Python • Rust • TypeScript • Go • Bash

**Infrastructure:** Docker • Linux • PostgreSQL • nginx • Git

## Featured Projects

- [**WeNMR Portal**](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl) ([csbportal](https://github.com/haddocking)) - Production monorepo serving structural biology tools. Go backend (Gin, JWT, PostgreSQL/GORM, scheduled tasks), Python Flask app (OAuth2/OIDC, SQLAlchemy, APScheduler), Rust microservices (Tokio, Axum), TypeScript/React frontend, full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker orchestration

- [**job-orchestrator**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/job-orchestrator) - Asynchronous job orchestrator built in Rust with quota-based load balancing for distributed computational workloads. REST API with async/await patterns

- [**haddock3-webapp**](https://github.com/i-VRESSE/haddock3-webapp) - TypeScript/React workflow builder application with backend integration. Handles complex scientific workflows through a visual interface

- [**jobd**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/jobd) - Lightweight Go REST API daemon for containerized environments. Handles file transfer operations and job management with minimal overhead

- [**haddock-restraints**](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-restraints) - High-performance Rust CLI tool for processing molecular data. Focuses on performance optimization and parallel processing

- [**remotesysmonitor**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/remotesysmonitor) - Rust-based CLI for distributed server monitoring and health checks across multiple systems

## Side Projects

- [**game-of-life**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/game-of-life) - Conway's Game of Life implementation using Rust + WebAssembly with a React frontend
- [**get-up-timer**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/get-up-timer) - Linux daemon that monitors keyboard/mouse activity and reminds you to take breaks (systemd integration)
- [**curlc**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/curlc) - Learning project to building a curl clone in Rust to understand HTTP protocols better
- [**gdock**](https://github.com/rvhonorato/gdock) - Started as a pandemic pet-project, evolved into functional scientific software
