Hi! I'm [Rodrigo](https://www.rvhonorato.me), my main area of research is Macromolecular Interactions and I am a postdoctoral researcher at [BonvinLab](https://www.bonvinlab.org), developing [HADDOCK](https://www.wenmr.science.uu.nl) (source code and web application) amongst other **Research Software**. I've also built [gdock](https://www.gdock.org) to stay busy during quarantine. (:
