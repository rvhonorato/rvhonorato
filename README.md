# Hi there, I'm Rodrigo! 👋🏽

I write distributed systems, scientific computing tools, and infrastructure for production workloads. Currently spending most of my time on the [WeNMR Portal](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl) and [HADDOCK](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3) ecosystem at Utrecht University, working with a polyglot monorepo of Go/Python/Rust microservices for computational structural biology.
